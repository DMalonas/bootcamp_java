Please consider the following scenario:
We have a file containing an array of two property JSON entries, index and value.
We also have a text file with text in it.
Each sentence in the text file corresponds to a an entry's value in the JSON.
We want to match the text from each value to the appropriate chunk of text from the
text file. The final result should look like Sample_final.json's.
Write the final result to a output.json file
